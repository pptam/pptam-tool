# Train Ticket：A Benchmark Microservice System

The project is a train ticket booking system based on microservice architecture which contains 41 microservices. The programming languages and frameworks it used are as below.
- Java - Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
- Node.js - Express
- Python - Django
- Go - Webgo
- DB - Mongo、MySQL

You can get more details at [Wiki Pages](https://github.com/FudanSELab/train-ticket/wiki).

## Service Architecture Graph

## Quick Start
We provide k8s deployment to quickly deploy our application:  [Using Kubernetes](#Using-Kubernetes).

### Using Kubernetes
Here is the steps to deploy the Train Ticket onto any existing Kubernetes cluster.

#### Presequisite
* An existing Kubernetes cluster
* Helm supported, you can see https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/ for helm install
* PVC supported, you can see https://openebs.io/docs/2.12.x/user-guides/installation for localPV support.

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/FudanSELab/train-ticket.git 
cd train-ticket/
```

#### 2. Deploy the application
### For Quick Start
```bash
make deploy

```

Note: if you want specify namespace, set Namespace paramter:

```bash
make deploy Namespace=yournamespace
```

### Deploy Mysql Clusters For Each Services

```bash
make deploy DeployArgs="--independent-db"
```

### With Moinitorig
```bash
make deploy DeployArgs="--with-monitoring"
```

### With Distributed Tracing
```bash
make deploy DeployArgs="--with-tracing"
```

### Deploy All 
```bash
make deploy DeployArgs="--all"
```

### Customise Deployment
You can freely combine parameters for custom deployment， for example, deploy with monitoring and tracing:

```bash
make deploy DeployArgs="--with-tracing --with-monitoring"
```

### Reset Deployment

```
make reset-deploy
# if you specify namespace when deploy, set namespace as well when reset
# make reset-deploy Namespace=yournamespace
```

#### 3. Run `kubectl get pods` to see pods are in a ready state

#### 4. Visit the Train Ticket web page at [http://[Node-IP]:32677](http://[Node-IP]:32677).


## Build From Source
In the above, We use pre-built images to quickly deploy the application.

If you want to build the application from source, you can refer to [the Installation Guide](https://github.com/FudanSELab/train-ticket/wiki/Installation-Guide).
