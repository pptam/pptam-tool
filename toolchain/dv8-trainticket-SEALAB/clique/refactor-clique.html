            <li>Clique manifests as a circular dependency between DRH modules after DRH clustering with DSM.
                <ul>
                    <li>DRH aggregates the files with the strongest coupling into modules.</li>
                    <li>If there is a dependency between DRH modules, there is a possibility that these modules can be further decoupled into stand-alone modules.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Analyze the activity of these modules. If they have already generated high maintenance costs and will continue to be active, they should be refactored.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>These DRH modules should be examined for the following characteristics before refactoring:
                <ul>
                    <li>Whether the files in the DRH module are semantically consistent.</li>
                    <li>Whether the dependencies between modules is worth decoupling, i.e. whether these DRH modules form separate functional modules.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Refactoring method: Decoupling between modules by using dependency inversion.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Use DV8 to extract the design space led by the module that needs to be refactored, and put all the files in the space into a refactoring branch.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Do the following in the refactoring branch:
                <ul>
                    <li>Design the corresponding decoupling design rule files, i.e. interface files, so that the original coupling modules rely only on these interface files, not on each other (depending on inverted).</li>
                    <li>If the module is too large, or if the files in the module are too long, consider decoupling the file into multiple small files, or decoupling a large module into multiple small modules, ensuring that the modules depend only on the interface and not on each other.</li>
                    <li>The development team can use the degree of evolutionary coupling to determine which files should form a module.</li>
                    <li>Write the appropriate unit test cases to ensure that the new code is functionally correct.</li>
                    <li>Make sure the new code doesn't have code smells.</li>
                    <li>Using DV8, detect:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Whether the refactored code conforms to the target design.</li>
                            <li>Whether the modules truly decoupled.</li>
                            <li>Whether the decoupling score has improved.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
